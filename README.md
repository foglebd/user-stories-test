1. A reminder app that keeps track of important tasks

- AS a disorganized consumer
- I want to be reminded of important tasks
- So that I can take care of all my errands in a day

- Given that I have an app account
- When I log upcoming tasks
- Then I am reminded of those tasks as they come closer
